## Rachel Hoffman
I am a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, class of 2014. I have worked in marketing and communications for the past several years and am currently studying computer engineering at SoftStack Factory.
<br><br>

## Currently
SoftStack Factory is a 12-week immersion software development bootcamp that teaches hybrid mobile development. We spent the 12 weeks learning JavaScript and frameworks that allowed us to create mobile frontends and backend servers to support our mobile applications.
<br><br>
At SoftStack Factory we worked on a real world application for a client where I was a team member in delivering the solution to the client. This project took the team 6 weeks to complete, where we had a kickoff meeting with the client, we then created wireframes via Balsamic that were then approved by the client. The work was assigned using pivotal tracker an Agile project management tool where I was focused on the mobile User interface team. The Hybrid mobile application was built using the Ionic framework and itâ€™s command line tools that facilitated the creation of native application using JavaScript and other web technologies. We also created an mBaaS to support the frontend, in which I spent testing the REST services that the front end used.
